    "text": "After thoroughly considering its placement, Thomas finally decided to build a gazebo in his backyard, not because he needed one, but simply because he thought the word “gazebo” sounded cool and trendy.  To do this, he started with the foundation.  Thomas purchased a pallet of $2 \\times 1$ bricks (each of which may be rotated 90 degrees to become $1 \\times 2$ bricks), and he planned to lay all of them (he does not want to waste a single one!) so that they formed a square with no holes or gaps between bricks.  However, after many hours trying to create a square out of the bricks, he thinks it may not be possible.\n\nNot to be deterred, Thomas has decided to buy more bricks!  Since bricks are expensive and heavy to carry, he wants to buy as few extra bricks as needed to construct his square foundation.  Please help Thomas determine how many more bricks he will need to buy to make a square foundation. ",
    "problem": "Given the number of $2 \\times 1$ bricks Thomas already has, compute the number of additional bricks he needs to buy to construct a square foundation for his gazebo. ",
    "input": "The first and only line of input will contain a single integer, $b$ ($1 \\leq b \\leq 10^9$), representing the number of bricks Thomas already bought that day.",
    "output": "Output a line containing a single integer, $x$, representing the minimum number of additional bricks Thomas needs to buy to build the foundation of the gazebo. ",
